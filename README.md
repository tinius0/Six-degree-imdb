# Six-Degree-IMDb

A Python-based tool for exploring the "Six Degrees of Separation" in movies and actors using IMDb-style data.

## Description

This project uses movie and actor data (in TSV format) to calculate the distance between two actors through shared appearances in movies. The idea is inspired by the "Six Degrees of Separation" theory.

## Repository Contents

- **`actors.tsv`** – Tab-separated file with actor data (ID, name, etc.).
- **`movies.tsv`** – Tab-separated file with movie data (ID, title, year, etc.).
- **`SixDegreeSearcg.py`** – Python program (note: filename seems misspelled) that implements search logic for actor connections.
- **`Oppgave4.py`** – Another Python script, likely related to a specific assignment or subproblem.
